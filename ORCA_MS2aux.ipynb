Please set all applicable variables above the '###' line. Tinkering with the code below the '###' line is highly encouraged, as that is precisely why we chose to make the code available as a Jupyter Notebook, however it could result in a 'breaking' of ORCA. If that appears to be the case, simply clone again from GitHub to get back to working code.\n",

    "This notebook was created several years after ORCA, in order to dig deeper into MS2 fragmentation patterns. Initial analyses using GNPS Classic Molecular Networking (https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) revealed a cluster of MS2 nodes that were networked together, suggesting that they were analogs. In an effort to understand how these nodes might be related, we put together the below code."
