Please set all applicable variables above the '###' line.

    "### Custom retention time function\n",
    "The original intent behind the design of ORCA was to be able to perform MS1 analyses on heterogeneous datasets (e.g. comparing data files acquired at different time points, under different chromatographic conditions, etc). In particular, we were faced with comparing current samples and legacy samples that had been run on similar but not the same chromatgraphic method (namely, a 2-min increase in run length to compensate for a XX decrease in flow-rate). This meant that using retention time as a second dimension (along with m/z) to charcaterize MS1 features did not allow of the proper consolidation of MS1 features across different samples. We were able to overcome this by instead using relative retention, along with applying an appropriate relative retention time tolerance window as determined through manual validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets that are more chromatographically hterogeneous than ours will likely require more complex functions applied to retention time in order for it to remain a reasonable and reliable second dimension by which MS1 features can be consolidated.

    "Here are descriptions and recommendations for the different parameters to be set\n",
    "\n",
    "**bin_width**: The first step in generating feature lists for each sample is to divide the range of m/z values to be considered into bins, sorting features into these bins based on m/z, and then grouping peaks within each bin based on those peaks occurring in consecutive MS1 scans. Bin width determines the size of these bins. Appropriately setting bin width depends on the resolution of the instrument(s) from which data was acquired, and is essentially a form or m/z tolerance. For low resolution instruments/heterogenous sample sets, 1 is a safe starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bin_offset**: This parameter is unnecessary for most uses, and so should defaultly be set to 0. It is useful in cases where a systematic bias in m/z is seen in the data, e.g. if a feature that should have an m/z of 100.0 is consistently being recorded as 100.3, a bin_offset of 0.3 may be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bins_start**: The lowest m/z to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bins_end**: The highest m/z to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**peak_consecutivity**: This parameter designates how 'consecutive' peaks need to be in order to be considered as composing the same feature. A value of 0 means that peaks will only be considered as part of a singular feature if there are 0 MS1 scans between them in which the peak does not appear. A value of 1 means that if a peak does not appear in one MS1 scan, but it does appear in the scans directly before and after, those instances can will still be grouped together as one feature. For guidedance in setting this parameter, take a look at your data - do peaks tend to occur in consecutive MS1 scans, or are there sometimes gaps?\n",
    "\n",
    "**peak_cluster_size_cutoff**: This parameter designates how wide (e.g. how many consecutive scans it is found across) a potential feature needs to be in order to be considered a true feature. For example, setting this parameter to 3 means that a potential feature must be recorded in three or more scans meeting the consecutivity criyteria designated via the peak_consecutivity parameter in order to be considered a true feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**min_integral**: Minimum integral a potential feature must have in order to be considered a true feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rt_setting**: This parameter determines what is used as the second dimension, along with m/z, is used for defining specific features. The options are 'raw' for using regular retention time, 'relative' for using relative retention time, or 'custom' for applying a custom retention time function that the user can define above.\n"

    "### Feature selection\n",
    "For feature selection, ORCA uses univariate feature selection, as implemented in sklearn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Univariate feature selection was selected as the optimal strategy of feature selection for this particular problem (e.g. identifying the most important features in driving clustering of different groups of samples) as it considers features individually and so is not negatively impacted by correlated features. In order to truly judge the statistical significance of features, univariate feature selection must be applied to a dataset with proper numbers of replicates per category of sample, and must also meet the three assumptions necessary for applying the ANOVA statistical test (here is a good resource for reviewing those assumptions: https://sites.ualberta.ca/~lkgray/uploads/7/3/6/2/7362679/slides_-_anova_assumptions.pdf) Even in cased where the assumptions are not met, or there are not enough replicate samples per category, feature selection can still be helpful for generating hypotheses about which features may be significant. To conduct univariate feature selection, please set the below parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**sample_labels**: Input the column name from the metadata table that you would like samples to be grouped by.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ref_for_labels**: This should be the column name whose contents exactly match the sample names in df_transformed. This will allow the sample (grouping) labels to be properly mapped to the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**top_k**: Number of top features to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rank_by**: Column to rank results by. This could be 'p-value' or 'F-values', if the goal is to see the most statistically significant features, as determined by univariate feature selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ascending**: Setting this variable to 'True' will list values from the designated column (as indicated with the 'rank_by' variable) from smallest to largest, while setting it to 'False' will list the values from largest to smallest.\n",

    "\n",
    "While m/z of an MS1 feature is not enough information to confidently identify what compound is in a sample, cross referencing features with lists of known compounds can allow for quick dereplication, which is very helfpul in the context of natural products discovery. The cell below allows one to load in a table of known compounds, their masses, and expected m/z for protenated and sodiated peaks, and then annotate features in your dataset based on this set of known compounds. By default, features are ordered based on which are the most prominent (e.g. which features have the largest values).\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters to set are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**mz_tolerance**: How close a feature's m/z must be to the protenated or sodiated m/z of a known compound in order for the feature to be annotated as that known compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "**top_k**: Number of features to output. Note: features are ranked by greattest value to smallest value, as determined by selecting the max value for a feature across all samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**db_path**: Path to table of known compounds to be used for annotation. Table must be a csv file with at least three columns: 'Name', 'Protenated Peak', and 'Sodiated Peak'."
